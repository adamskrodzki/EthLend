      This project allow to connect people who has ETH but have no programming
      skills with those who has programming skills but no ETH, so both can
      profit on Ethereum Network arbitrage opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any Smart Contract is capable of borrowing ETH from common pool as long as
      it returns all of Ethere (with fee) before transaction ends. If Smart
      Contract fails to do so transaction will revert.
    </p>
    <b>
      This way ETH pooled in Smart Contract is never at risk, but still can be
      used and give profit.
